        Objectives
.Define what dynamic programming is 
.Explain what overlapping subproblems are 
.Understand what optimal substructure is 
.Solve more challenging problems using dynamic programming 

        Whay is Dynamic Programming 
.A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. 

        Dynamic Programming 
It only works on problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

        Overlapping Subproblems
A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times. 

        Optimal Substructure 
A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
