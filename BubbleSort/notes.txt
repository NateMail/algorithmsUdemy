        How JavaScript .sort works
. The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator funciton.
. You can use this comparator funtion to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort 
.  The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), 
determines their sort order based on the return value 
    . If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
    . If it returns a positive number, a should come after b 
    . If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned.

 A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!
