/* 
    ================================================================
    Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum. 
    ================================================================


    Understand the Problem.
    . Can I restate the problem in my own words?
        "impliment addition"

    . What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        -ints?
        -floats?
        -what about string for large numbers?

    . What are the outpus that should come from the solution to the problem?
        -int?
        -float?
        -string?

    . Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?(You many not be able to anser this question until you set about solving the problem.  That's okay; it's still worth considerting the question at this early stage.)

    . How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
