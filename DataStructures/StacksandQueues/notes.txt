            What is a stack?
It is a collection of data. That follows a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack 


            How is it used?
Think of it like a stack of plates. 
As you pile it up the last thing (or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first. 

            Where stacks are used? 
. Managing funciton invocations
. Undo / Redo 
. Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
