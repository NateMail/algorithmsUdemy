        What is a Hash Table?
.Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.
.They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
.Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing value!

        The Hash Part 
.To impliment a hash tabe, we'll be using an array.
.In order to look up values by key, we need a way to convert keys into valid array indices. 
.A funciton that preforems this task is called a hash function. 

        What makes a good Hash?
.Fast(i.e constant time)
.Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly 
.Deterministic (same input yields same output)
