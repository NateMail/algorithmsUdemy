        Objectives 
.Define what a binary heap is
.Compare and contrast min and max heaps 
.Implement basic methods on heaps 
.Understanding where heaps are used in the real world and what other data structures can be constructed from heaps 


        What is a binary heap?
. Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
.In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
.In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than the child nodes.

        Max Binary Heap 
.Each parent has at most two child nodes 
.The value of each parent node is always greater than its child (opposite of min binary search tree)
.In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes. 
.A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first 

        What is a priority Queue?
.A data structure where each element has a priority.
.Elments with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.
