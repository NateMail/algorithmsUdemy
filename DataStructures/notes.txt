        Examples 
    .Binary Search .Queues .Singly Linked Lists .Undirected Unweighted Graphs .Binary Heaps 
    .Directed Graphs .Hash Tables .Doubly Linked Lists .Stacks 

        What are data structures?
Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.   

        Why so many???
Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used. 

. Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required
. Arrays contain a built in index where as Linked Lists do not 
. The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
