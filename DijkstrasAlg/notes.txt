        Objectives
.Understand the importance of Dijkstra's 
.Implement a Weighted Graph 
.Walk through the steps of Dijkstra's 
.Implement Dijkstra's using a naive priority queue
.Implement Dijkstra's using a binary heap priority queue 

        What is it?
.Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph 
."What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"

        Why is it useful?
.GPS - finding fastest route 
.Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data 
.Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans 
.Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination 
.Many other uses!
