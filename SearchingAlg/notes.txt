    Objectives
. Describe what a searching algorithm is 
. Implement linear search on arrays 
. Implement binary search on sorted arrays
. Implement a naive string searching algorithm. 
. Implement the KMP string searching algorithm 

    Binary Search 
    . Binary search is a much faster form of search.
    . Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time 
    . Binary search only workds on sorted arrays!
