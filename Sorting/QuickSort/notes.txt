        Quick Sort 
. Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
. Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array 
. Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot. 

        Quick Sort Break Down 
    [5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 7, 6, 3]
        select 5 and move everything smaller to the left 
    3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8
        select 3 on the left side 
    2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8
        select 2 on the left side 
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8
        select right side 7
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
        final array 
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    . The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot.
    . Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the median value in the data set you're sorting
